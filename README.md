# Courses

This is my repo with all my courses / small projects to learn things. This was previously my folder Cours/deep_learning/ and I decided to put it on GitHub.

Here I can find the courses that I wrote and the different exercices / note that I took.

Here's the list of the different folders:

- PyTorch_tp: A course that I wrote from videos and tutos I found on internet
- DL_course: Course that I wrote from MachineLearnIA a french AI youtuber. It also contains some TP and some cheatsheet on several things such as the optimizers.
- Harvard_courses: This folder contains several folders from the notes / exercices that I took from the Harvard courses I joined.
